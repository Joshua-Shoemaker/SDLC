# Software Development Life Cycle

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
- Interpreting user needs is a common source of confusion; therefore, I focus on extracting clear and definitive requirements. Users often describe what they want to accomplish, and translating these needs into user stories with specific acceptance criteria helps define success. A well-written user story establishes a clear definition of done, ensuring a focused and achievable minimum viable product.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- I approach development by breaking down requirements into manageable tasks and iterating on solutions to refine functionality. I aim to apply Agile practices such as iterative development, rapid prototyping, and test-driven development to refine solutions efficiently.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- Being a good team member means communicating effectively, collaborating to solve problems, and contributing to shared goals. It involves writing clean, maintainable code, respecting othersâ€™ ideas, and being receptive to feedback. A strong team member also supports teammates by sharing knowledge and helping to remove roadblocks.
